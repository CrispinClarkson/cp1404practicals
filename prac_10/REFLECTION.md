# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy wasn't terrible, they wouldn't differ too much, but for the larger projects the accuracy wouldn't 
be as high.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Initially, my estimates were based on optimism, constantly underestimating the time I should complete a task. But, as
I progressed through this subject, I subconsciously made the estimate more accurate based on previous pracs. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimates are directly tied to confidence and familiarity. When I work with known concepts, my estimates
were precise, however, when doing topics like dictionaries, these estimates were often wrong, not being able to predict
the learning curve.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

That I tend to overlook the most simple things. Seeing the feedback where I overlook naming or even docstrings makes me
realise that I focus more on the complex sections of the code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Doing the code review from another person gave me insight on what other approaches there are to a task. 

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Good Review 1](https://github.com/julianajesss/cp1404practicals/pull/1#discussion_r2467658712)

### Explanation

The feedback I provided was a mix of compliments on the sections I liked and constructive criticism on sections that
needed refinement. Sections where I found a bit questionable did not receive direct feedback but rather in a form of a
rhetorical question.

### Good Code Review 2

### Explanation

I have only received 1 code review in total.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

More practicals surrounding the big assignment at the end of the trimester. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I was consistent with practical submissions, despite having other assignments going on at the same time. I would
especially say that I did decent for most topics taught in CP1404.
