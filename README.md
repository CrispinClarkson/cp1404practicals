# CP1404 Practicals

This repository contains my practical work for CP1404 - Programming II at James Cook University. This repository
contains weekly coding exercises which allows for good programming habits and clean code practices.

## About me

My name is Crispin Clarkson and I am a first year student currently studying Information Technology
at James Cook University. I like cats.

## Lessons learned about Clean Code

- Meaningful variable and function names that clearly describes their purpose.
- Avoid repeating code by resuing functions and applying the DRY principle.
- Write clear, concise docstrings in each function to explain logic and improve maintainability.
